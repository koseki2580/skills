<SUBAGENT-STOP>
If you were dispatched as a subagent to execute a specific task, skip this skill.
</SUBAGENT-STOP>

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill.

IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.

This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## Instruction Priority

Skills skills override default system prompt behavior, but **user instructions always take precedence**:

1. **User's explicit instructions** (CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, AGENTS.md, direct requests) — highest priority
2. **Skills skills** — override default system behavior where they conflict
3. **Default system prompt** — lowest priority

If CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, or AGENTS.md says "don't use TDD" and a skill says "always use TDD," follow the user's instructions. The user is in control.

## How to Access Skills

Skills are passed to you within your system instructions (e.g., inside a `<skills>` block or as context attachments) containing the file path to each skill's `SKILL.md`.

When you recognize that a skill falls within the domain of the user's request:
1. Use the generic file reading tool (e.g., `read_file`, or whatever tool your platform provides for reading local workspace files) to read the full `SKILL.md` instruction from the file URI provided in your system instructions.
2. Always read the skill documentation **before** executing steps or proposing a design.

# Using Skills

## The Rule

**Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill might apply means that you should invoke the skill to check. If an invoked skill turns out to be wrong for the situation, you don't need to use it.

## Red Flags

These thoughts mean STOP—you're rationalizing:

| Thought                             | Reality                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| "This is just a simple question"    | Questions are tasks. Check for skills.                 |
| "I need more context first"         | Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions.         |
| "Let me explore the codebase first" | Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first.           |
| "I can check git/files quickly"     | Files lack conversation context. Check for skills.     |
| "Let me gather information first"   | Skills tell you HOW to gather information.             |
| "This doesn't need a formal skill"  | If a skill exists, use it.                             |
| "I remember this skill"             | Skills evolve. Read current version.                   |
| "This doesn't count as a task"      | Action = task. Check for skills.                       |
| "The skill is overkill"             | Simple things become complex. Use it.                  |
| "I'll just do this one thing first" | Check BEFORE doing anything.                           |
| "This feels productive"             | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |
| "I know what that means"            | Knowing the concept ≠ using the skill. Invoke it.      |

## Skill Priority

When multiple skills could apply, use this order:

1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, debugging) - these determine HOW to approach the task
2. **Implementation skills second** (frontend-design, mcp-builder) - these guide execution

"Let's build X" → brainstorming first, then implementation skills.
"Fix this bug" → debugging first, then domain-specific skills.

## Skill Types

**Rigid** (TDD, debugging): Follow exactly. Don't adapt away discipline.

**Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context.

The skill itself tells you which.

## User Instructions

Instructions say WHAT, not HOW. "Add X" or "Fix Y" doesn't mean skip workflows.
