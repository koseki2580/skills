# Commit Message Convention (Skills)

## Overview

This project follows a structured commit message convention based on:

- Conventional Commits
- Emoji-enhanced readability
- Context-specific commit types
- Strict single-responsibility commits

All commit messages MUST follow the defined format and rules.

---

## Format

```
type(scope): :emoji: : description
```

### Example

```
feat(parser): ✨ : add support for TCP packet parsing
fix(api): 🐛 : resolve nil pointer in request handler
refactor(core): ♻️ : simplify queue processing logic
```

---

## Rules

- Always include `type`
- `scope` is recommended (module, feature, or component name)
- Use lowercase for `type` and `description`
- Keep descriptions concise and meaningful
- Use present tense (e.g., "add", "fix", not "added", "fixed")

---

## Critical Rule: One Commit = One Responsibility

- Each commit MUST represent exactly one logical change
- Do NOT mix multiple concerns in a single commit

### ❌ Bad

```
feat: ✨ : add API endpoint and fix typo in docs
```

### ✅ Good

```
feat(api): ✨ : add new endpoint for user creation
docs(api): 📝 : fix typo in API documentation
```

### Guidelines

- Separate refactoring from feature changes
- Separate bug fixes from improvements
- Separate formatting changes from logic changes
- If a commit message uses "and", it is likely incorrect

## Emoji Type

| Type        | Description                           | Emoji |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- | ----- |
| feat        | New feature                           | ✨    |
| fix         | Bug fix                               | 🐛    |
| docs        | Documentation                         | 📝    |
| test        | Add/update tests                      | ✅    |
| chore       | Maintenance/misc                      | 🔧    |
| debug       | Add debug/logging                     | 🐞    |
| hotfix      | Critical production fix               | 🚑    |
| investigate | Root cause investigation              | 🔍    |
| revert      | Revert changes                        | ⏪    |
| refactor    | Code refactoring (no behavior change) | ♻️    |
| perf        | Performance improvement               | ⚡    |
| cleanup     | Remove unused/dead code               | 🧹    |
| style       | Formatting / lint fixes               | 🎨    |

## Final Rules

- A commit is not complete unless it clearly communicates intent
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Keep history readable and meaningful
- Code and commit history should tell the same story
