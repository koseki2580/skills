# Operating Mode & Adaptive Depth

**Use the lightest process that safely completes the task.** Do not use a deeper mode unless it adds value.

- **Minimal** (Trivial changes, typos, formatting-only changes, small internal refactors, or obvious one-line fixes):
  - Answer or edit directly while preserving **Simplicity First**, **Surgical Changes**, and **Validation Before Completion**.
  - Use direct verification. Use a short plan only if helpful. Do not invoke skills, sub-agents, or documentation workflows unless strictly necessary.
  - **User-facing micro-changes stay Minimal** when only surface text changes and the behavior contract is unchanged (e.g., error message wording, log strings, microcopy). The moment behavior, public API shape, schema, or operational semantics change — even by one field — escalate to Standard and apply Section 8 (Specification-Driven Development).

- **Standard** (Normal feature, non-trivial bugfix, or meaningful multi-file change):
  - Check `agents/tasks/lessons.md` before implementation when useful.
  - Use a task-specific file under `agents/tasks/active/` when the task has multiple steps, risk, or meaningful uncertainty.

- **Comprehensive** (High-risk, architectural, public API, security, data model, or production-impacting change):
  - Write or update a comprehensive plan.
  - Identify success criteria and rollback considerations.
  - Use tests when appropriate.
  - Update docs/specs when behavior, API, architecture, or user-facing expectations change.
  - **Approval Gates:** Pause for explicit approval before:
    - changing public APIs, data models, security boundaries, or architecture
    - executing infrastructure changes (e.g., `terraform apply` or `kubectl apply`)
    - implementing a plan with unresolved tradeoffs
    - proceeding after discovering scope expansion or conflicting requirements
  - **Approval format:** Wait for an explicit affirmative from the user (e.g., "approve", "ok", "go", "yes", "進めて") before proceeding past a gate. Do **not** treat continuation messages, follow-up questions, related comments, or silence as approval. If the next user message does not clearly authorize the gated action, restate the gate and ask again rather than inferring consent.

## Workflow Design

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.
- **If available and appropriate, consider using the `brainstorming` skill** to explore user intent, requirements, and design before any creative work or implementation.

### 2. Default to Plan Mode

- For non-trivial tasks involving 3 or more meaningful implementation steps, risky changes, or architectural decisions, always start in Plan Mode
- If things stop working midway, do not push forward blindly—pause and re-plan immediately
- Use Plan Mode not only for implementation, but also for validation steps
- To reduce ambiguity, write a short specification before implementation when requirements are unclear or behavior changes are significant
- **If available and appropriate, consider using the `writing-plans` skill** when you have a spec or requirements for a multi-step task, before touching code.

---

### 3. Sub-Agent Strategy

- Use sub-agents only when tasks are independent, complex, or benefit from parallel investigation.
- Do not overcomplicate simple tasks with sub-agent overhead.
- When useful, delegate research, investigation, or parallel analysis to sub-agents
- For complex problems, consider allocating more computational resources via sub-agents
- Assign exactly one task per sub-agent to maintain focus
- **If available and appropriate, consider using the `subagent-driven-development` skill** when executing implementation plans with independent tasks.
- **If available and appropriate, consider using the `dispatching-parallel-agents` skill** when facing 2+ independent tasks that can be worked on without shared state.

---

### 4. Self-Improvement Loop

- **For Standard or Comprehensive tasks, check `agents/tasks/lessons.md` before implementation when useful.**
- Whenever you receive corrections from the user, record the pattern in `agents/tasks/lessons.md`
- Use the template in `agents/tasks/lessons.template.md` (four fields: What happened / Rule / Why / Apply-when)
- Keep each lesson ≤ 5 lines of body; if longer, split into multiple entries
- Every non-trivial plan should include a final checkpoint: consider whether a lesson should be appended.
- Append only when there was a user correction, repeated mistake, surprising failure, or reusable insight.
- Write rules for yourself to avoid repeating the same mistakes
- Continuously refine these rules until the error rate decreases

---

### 5. Always Validate Before Completion

- **If available and appropriate, consider using the `finishing-a-development-branch` skill** when implementation is complete and you need to decide how to integrate the work (merge/PR/cleanup).
- **If available and appropriate, consider using the `requesting-code-review` skill** before merging to verify work meets requirements.

- Do not mark a task as complete until its behavior is proven
- When necessary, review the diff between the main branch and your changes
- Ask yourself: “Would a staff engineer approve this?”
- Run tests, check logs, and demonstrate that everything works correctly
- **If available and appropriate, consider using the `verification-before-completion` skill** when about to claim work is complete, fixed, or passing, to strictly run verification commands.

---

### 6. Strive for Elegance (with Balance)

- Before making significant changes, pause and ask: “Is there a more elegant solution?”
- If a fix feels like a hack, rethink it and implement a more robust solution based on everything you know
- Skip this process for simple and obvious fixes (avoid over-engineering)
- Always review your own work critically before presenting it

---

### 7. Autonomous Bug Fixing

- When receiving a bug report, fix it without requiring step-by-step guidance
- Use logs, errors, and failing tests to identify and resolve the issue independently
- Minimize the need for the user to switch context
- If CI failures are directly related to the current change, fix them. If unrelated, report them separately unless the user asks to fix them.
- **Fail-safe:** If you fail to fix the same failing test or error after 3 attempts, or if your fixes keep introducing new failures, STOP and ask the user for help. Do not enter an infinite loop of trial and error.
- **If available and appropriate, consider using the `systematic-debugging` skill** when encountering any bug, test failure, or unexpected behavior, before proposing fixes.

---

### 8. Specification-Driven Development

- **For user-facing behavior, public API, architecture, or important operational behavior changes:**
  - Before implementation, write or update the specification in `docs/`
  - Always consult `docs/README.md` to determine the correct location for your changes or new specifications.
  - If you create a new document or change the structure, you MUST update `docs/README.md` alongside it to keep the documentation index current.

**When a specification is required or updated:**

- Review and validate the specification before writing code.
- After implementation, update the specification to reflect the actual behavior.
- Ensure that documentation matches the current implementation.
- If the implementation differs from the specified behavior, update the spec immediately to prevent discrepancies.

---

### 9. Docs–Tests Consistency

- When updating specifications in `docs/`, ensure corresponding test cases are updated if applicable.

- Tests are the executable representation of the specification:
  - If docs change, tests MUST reflect that change
  - If tests no longer match docs, they MUST be updated immediately

- Keep intended behavior (specs/docs), validated behavior (tests), and actual behavior (code) consistent.

- **If available and appropriate, consider using the `test-driven-development` skill** when implementing any feature or bugfix, before writing implementation code.

---

### 10. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Safety

**Treat infrastructure changes with maximum caution.**

- **Never autonomously execute commands that alter infrastructure** (e.g., `terraform apply`, `kubectl apply`, `aws cloudformation deploy`).
- ALWAYS stop at the planning stage (e.g., `terraform plan`, `kubectl diff`, `pulumi preview`).
- If the plan generates a diff, explicitly report **what the diff changes** to the user (additions, modifications, destructions).
- Wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding with any infrastructure mutation.

---

## Task Management

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.** (Goal-Driven Execution)
Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For non-trivial or multi-step coding tasks, use a task-specific file (e.g., `agents/tasks/active/<task-name>.md`) to track the plan. Avoid using a single global `todo.md` to prevent merge conflicts during parallel development.
For trivial changes, do not create or update task files unless useful.

For multi-step tasks, use verifiable step loops:

```text
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria require constant clarification.

When using a task file (`agents/tasks/active/<task-name>.md`):

1. **Start with a plan**: Document what was requested, what will be done, and write a checklist-style plan.
2. **Review the plan**: Ask for user confirmation only when the plan changes scope, affects risky areas, or has meaningful ambiguity.
3. **Track progress**: Mark items as complete as you go.
4. **Explain changes**: Provide high-level summaries at meaningful checkpoints.
5. **Summarize results**: Add a review section detailing what was actually done, how it was verified, and any remaining risks.
6. **Finalize & Clean up**: Do not commit active task logs to git. Ensure `agents/tasks/active/` is gitignored before writing task logs there; if needed, add it to `.gitignore`. Instead, distill the final summary into the PR description or commit message. Record reusable insights in `agents/tasks/lessons.md` only when there was a user correction, repeated mistake, or surprising failure.

**Recommended Task File Structure**
Use a structured format like HFS (Hypothesis, Findings, Solution) for clarity:

- **Context & Goal**: What was requested and the verifiable success criteria.
- **Hypothesis / Plan**: The initial approach and step-by-step verification loops.
- **Findings**: Issues encountered, log outputs, and learnings during execution.
- **Solution / Summary**: What was actually implemented, how it was verified, and the final extracted text for the PR description.

**Resume Safety**
For standard or comprehensive tasks, the task file must be sufficient to resume work after context loss. Keep it updated with:

- Current status and completed checklist items
- Next action
- Verification already performed
- Unresolved questions or risks

**Durable Questions**
For comprehensive-depth tasks with blocking ambiguity, record open questions in the task file instead of relying only on chat. Use this format:

- **Question:**
- **Options:**
- **Recommended default:**
- **Impact:**
- **Answer:** `<Wait for user to fill>`

Proceed only after the ambiguity is resolved or an explicit assumption is accepted.

**Optional Skill Use**

- **If available and appropriate, consider using the `executing-plans` skill** when you have a written implementation plan to execute with review checkpoints.

## Core Principles

### Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.
- Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

**Read before edit:**

- Read the full target file before editing it. Do not edit on the basis of a partial view.
- For non-trivial edits, also read direct callers, importers, and any tests that exercise the symbol you are changing. If the change crosses a public boundary, scan for all usages.
- If the file is too large to read whole, read the surrounding region plus every site that references the symbol you are touching.

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.
- The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### Quality

- **No Shortcuts**: Identify the root cause. Avoid temporary fixes. Maintain senior-level quality.
